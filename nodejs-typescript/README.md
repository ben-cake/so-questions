A simple example of the node express and jquery on the client application.
Both server and client sides use TypeScript.

Server-side app sources are under `/src` and client-side sources are under `/client`.
There are different TypeScript configurations for both (tsconfig.json in each folder).

Compile with `npm run-script compile` and then run with `npm start`.

During the compilation the resulting js files go under `/dist`.
