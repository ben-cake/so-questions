Task Instructions
Technical advisers for Citizen Measure have recommended that we exclusively use cryptographic functions from the following Python library: pycrypto.
This library has already been installed for your use. Linked documentation for pycrypto can be found at https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/doc/. Please use pycrypto to complete all of the tasks detailed below. Please try to use the linked documentation as much as possible, and only use other information resources (e.g. Google or StackOverflow) if the linked documentation is insufficient. However, if you use other information resources, please let us know by adding links to these resources as comments to the code you write.
1. Please use pycrypto to complete all of the tasks detailed below.
2. Please use the linked documentation for pycrypto as much as possible.
3. If you get stuck, please move on to the next task.
4. Please feel free to add comments or (debugging) print statements to your code. This may help you during development and the researchers who are reading your code.
5. Please use tabs instead of spaces to indent your code. Although this does not follow the PEP-8 convention, it makes reading the code in the online editor easier.
6. You can re-use code you wrote in previous input cells later in the study.
7. You can always modify the code in previous input cells. However, make sure your code is still working as expected.
